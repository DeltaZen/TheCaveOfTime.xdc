				Your friends are understanding about your wish to find the way back to your
				own time, but they tell you they can show you something you never dreamed
				of. Since their society is very primitive, you wonder what they could have
				in mind.

				Next day they lead you to another cove where the waves roll in, rise up
				against the cliff and then roll out again. Sometimes the waves clap against
				each other and send a foamy spray of water high in the air. You see some
				young people on tiny rafts—nothing more than surfboards—riding in on the
				crests of the waves and then riding them out on the rebound. In a few hours
				you have learned a sport that brings excitement and fascination for hour
				after hour.
			</p>

			<p>
				With such delights as this, it is not long before you lose interest in
				returning to your own time. Sometimes you wonder, but you never learn,
				whether this paradise lies in the future or the past.
