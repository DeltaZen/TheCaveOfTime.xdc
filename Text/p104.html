				When you tell him you come from theTwentieth Century through the Cave of
				Time, Nick smiles. Then you tell him a little about life in your own
				time—about cars and planes, telephones and television. He listens intently,
				with a big grin on his face, as if you are telling th funniest story ever
				told.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I’m so glad to meet you,” Nick says. “I’ve always wanted to know about
				life in the Twentieth Century.” He tries to look serious, but begins to
				laugh, thinking it’s all a joke.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Seriously,” you say (since you know he will never believe you), “I have no
				home. Do you know of a place where I can stay?”
			</p>

			<p>
				“I’m sure you can stay at our house,” he says warmly. “We have such a big
				family, one more won’t matter, but you must be willing to work in the shop
				with the rest of us.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Since you feel you hardly have any other choice, you accept his offer and
				feel grateful when his parents give you a good dinner and a comfortable
				bed. Nick tells you, with much seriousness, that you are living in the year
				1718 in Boston, the principal town in the British colony of Massachusetts.
			</p>

			<p>
				You soon become one of the family. They are good people and treat you well.
				But each day you have to work long hours boiling soap and pouring it into
				molds, waiting on customers and doing errands for Nick’s father, whom you
				have come to know as Uncle Ted.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your neighbor, Mr. Nelson, is a printer. He recently returned from England
				with a printing press and letter type he bought there. The business
				interests you, and you consider working as his apprentice, but to do so you
				would have to sign papers indenturing yourself to work faithfully for him
				for six full years.
