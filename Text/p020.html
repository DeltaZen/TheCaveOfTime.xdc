				The tunnel to the left winds around like a spiral, passing several more
				tunnels. You turn down one of them, then climb steeply. In a few moments
				you climb through a hole and emerge in a desert. The weather is extremely
				hotâ€”certainly over 100 degrees, but the sun is just about to set, so it
				should be getting cooler. In the distance is a range of mountains, which
				look extremely high, yet are bare of snow. You have no idea whether you are
				in the past, the future, or the present. Then you see something that
				fascinates and disturbs you. The sand seems to be fused into yellowish
				glass as if heated in a furnace. As you examine the sand more closely, you
				feel the air getting even hotter. Suddenly you realize the sun is not
				setting, but rising! The noontime temperature must be more than life can
				stand. As the sun rises higher, you feel a blistering wave of heat. The
				light is almost blinding. Could it be that you are witnessing the end of
				the world?
			</p>

			<p>
				You dive down into the tunnel, hoping you can make it back to an earlier
				time. Gratefully, you feel cool, damp air coming up from the cave. You are
				curious to try the next tunnel you come to, thinking that it may show the
				state of the world just before it began to bum up from the intensifying
				heat of the dying sun, or that it might show what happened afterward! But
				you suspect that a tunnel further on might be more likely to lead you back
				to your own time.
