				After following the passageway for a considerable distance, you enter a
				very large tunnel that seems as likely as any to lead you back to your own
				time. You continue along and soon notice that the floor of the tunnel is
				becoming sandier. Perhaps you are coming to a beach. Then the sand gives
				way under your feet; you slide through sand and rising dust. You cannot
				stop yourselfâ€”it is too steep; then there is nothing under your feet, and a
				moment later you land in deep water. You swim to the surface and catch your
				breath. You are in an underwater grotto, which seems completely sealed off
				except for a portion of its roof that is open to the blue sky. You swim to
				a large, smooth rock sloping into the water.
			</p>

			<p>
				The sand is white, and the water transparent. The rocks are made of
				crystalline material of the most delicate shades of blue. For a moment you
				are overwhelmed by the beauty of the scene before you, but you soon begin
				to wonder whether you can escape from it. There is no way of climbing out
				through the opening in the roof.
			</p>

			<p>
				You dive down in hopes of finding an underwater passageway that might lead
				to freedom, and you find one! But could you swim through it before running
				out of air?
