				Reasoning that you can always find your way back into the cave when you
				want to, you decide to explore the world in which you have found yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				You make your way along a rock ledge overlooking the plains and lakes,
				taking care to keep your bearings so you can find your way back to the
				cave.
			</p>

			<p>
				By now you are getting very hungry. You know that you are in the age of
				reptiles—at least 100 million years ago—and that mammals may not yet have
				appeared on earth. There will be no rabbits or deer to hunt, though the
				lakes may contain fish. You wonder how dinosaur eggs taste.
			</p>

			<p>
				You follow a wide path through the fern trees. When you round the first
				bend, you find yourself face to face with the horrible Triceratops, a great
				gray monster almost hidden behind its shields and horns. It looks at you
				curiously with dull brown eyes. You turn, run, and crash into a tree
				trunk—one that wasn’t there before!
			</p>

			<p>
				The bark feels like leather. You look up to see how high it is—into the
				jaws of Tyrannosaurus Rex.
