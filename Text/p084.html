				You run up the hill and out of sight before any of the primitive people
				awaken. You must find an entrance to the Cave of Time. You search in the
				high rocky ground for some opening. Hours go by; dusk is fast approaching.
				Just as you are about to give up hope, you spy the entrance to a cave under
				a rock ledge. You eagerly step inside and have only a momentâ€™s awareness
				that it is the den of a saber-toothed tiger.
