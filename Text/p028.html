				You can see no future for yourself with these primitive people, so you run
				back toward the Cave of Time. Fortunately, they do not follow you, and you
				are able to find your way.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the time you re-enter the cave, you are hungry and exhausted. The light
				is dimmer than before and you grope your way along, looking for a
				passageway. You stumble and fall headfirst down an embankment, bumping your
				head disagreeably. You look up and see daylight ahead. A minute later, you
				walk out of the cave into warm, moist air near a forest of leafy trees. A
				bird flies by. You don’t know <i>when</i> it is, but it looks pleasant
				enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suddenly you hear voices shouting. You hide in a thicket. An animal crashes
				through the brush. In a moment some men rush by in pursuit, carrying spears
				and slings. You imagine that you must be in an era long before the advent
				of civilization. You follow an animal trail; it soon leads to a clearing,
				and you lie down in the grass to rest. Looking up in the sky, you see a
				long, thin, white streak. You rub your eyes and look again. It seems to be
				a vapor trail from a jet plane! You may be living in the present time after
				all.
			</p>

			<p>
				After several days of wandering through the jungle, you reach a settlement
				on the banks of a large river. There is an airfield nearby, and within a
				few weeks you are able to obtain a ride back to civilization and return to
				your family—just a month after you first entered the Cave of Time. You are
				happy to be back home, but shocked at how much older everyone looks. And
				they express the greatest surprise that after eleven years you haven’t
				changed a bit!
