				You climb up the steps between the last car and the caboose just as the
				train begins to start up again. When you open the door to the car, you are
				surprised to see soldiers in blue uniforms holding old-fashioned rifles.
				They advance upon you. One of them strides past you to see if anyone else
				followed you.
			</p>

			<p>
				“How did you know this was the President’s car?” the first soldier asks
				you.
			</p>

			<p>
				“What President?” you reply.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then, to your amazement, you get the answer to your question, for the very
				tall bearded man walking down the aisle could be no one else but Abraham
				Lincoln.
			</p>

			<p>
				“That’s all right,” the President tells the soldiers, “I could use some
				company right now. You may stay until we reach Gettysburg,” he says to you.
				“But maybe you should get off at Parkersville. I know of some good people
				there who will help you out.”
