				Swimming through the underwater tunnel may be the only way to get out of
				the grotto, but the risk of drowning seems too great. You explore the rocks
				in the grotto and think about how you might possibly get up through the
				roof.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suddenly a voice calls, “Hello.” You whirl around and notice for the first
				time, huddled in the corner, a woman with sparkling blue eyes and a
				mysterious smile. She is sitting crosslegged, propped against a rock which
				is shaped in a way that gives her a comfortable seat. In her hands she is
				holding a flute, and as you stare in amazement she plays an unfamiliar
				melody with a sweetness and purity of tone such as you have never heard.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Hello,” you reply. “Tell me—who are you and how can we get out of here?”
			</p>

			<p>
				“Sit down,” she says, “and relax. You have all the time in the world.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“What do you mean?” you reply. “I am trapped. I slid down from the Cave of
				Time and I want to get out.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“Believe me,” the woman says, “there’s no way to get out; but do not be
				concerned. It is a beautiful place and you can be very happy here.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“But we’ll starve. How long have you been here?” you exclaim.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Forever and not at all,” she replies, “for this is the part of the cave
				which leads neither to the past nor to the future. Here, time does not
				exist, so, of course, you will never be hungry or bored, and, although you
				can never get out, you will be here for no time at all.”
			</p>

			<p>
				You sit down and rest your chin in your hands, unable to believe the fate
				that has befallen you. To live forever in a timeless world seems worse than
				death.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Well, to tell the truth, there is a way to get back to your own time,” the
				woman finally says, “but, if you follow it, you will not be able to live
				forever.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“I don’t care,” you say. “Show me the way.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“Very well,” she says, shaking her head in disbelief. “Dive under the rock
				ledge beneath me and swim through the tunnel you will find there. You will
				come up in your own time. Don’t worry, it’s only a few yards. You can make
				it.”
			</p>

			<p>
				You take a last look around, wave good-bye and dive. A few seconds later
				you surface in a pond just inside the entrance of the Cave of Time. You
				swim to shore and run out through the cave entrance into the open air,
				almost crashing into your Uncle Howard, who has come looking for you.
			</p>

			<p>
				“You’re late for dinner,” he says. “We wondered what happened to you. You
				ought to keep better track of the time.”
			</p>

				The End
