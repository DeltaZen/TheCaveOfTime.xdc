				You walk along the left-hand passageway, passing tunnels from time to time,
				none of which looks like a particularly appealing route. You decide to see
				if you can reach the end of the passageway.
			</p>

			<p>
				You walk on and on, hour after hour. Then, in the distance, you see a
				figure approachingâ€”a girl wearing blue jeans and a red sweater and carrying
				a backpack. She tells you that her name is Louisa and that she was
				exploring a cave and got lost. She does not know she is in the Cave of
				Time.
