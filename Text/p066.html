				You accept the offer, for you can hardly expect a better life at this
				point, and soon you begin to enjoy rowing out in the early morning mists
				and spreading your nets with the neighboring fishermen.
			</p>

			<p>
				One afternoon, as the people are pulling up their boats for the night, your
				friend, Angus McPhee, raises a cry and points at the water. You look out
				and see the great head and neck of a sea monster—a huge dragon of the lake.
				Nearby, splinters of wood are floating in the water.
			</p>

			<p>
				“That was Sutherland’s boat,” Angus cries out. “It’s been a hundred years
				since the monster has been seen, but now it has returned!”
			</p>

			<p>
				The monster swims away and soon is lost from view in the mists.
			</p>

			<p>
				“How could the monster be gone for a hundred years and then return?” you
				ask Angus.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Somewhere near Beatty’s Point,” he replies, “there is an underwater cave
				where the monster stays as long as it pleases—because it is a Cave of
				Time.”
			</p>

			<p>
				If only you could find your way back to the Cave of Time! But chances seem
				slim, and the risks seem great.
