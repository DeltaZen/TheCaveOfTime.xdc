				You follow the left passageway. It leads upward to the surface. Before you,
				a grassy meadow slopes down to a clear, fast-flowing stream; beyond it are
				pine-covered foothills stretching in the distance toward snow-covered
				peaks. You might be in Wyoming in your own time, but, whatever time it is,
				the world you see appears to be a hospitable one.
			</p>

			<p>
				You notice a herd of buffalo grazing. But nowhere can you see a house, or
				fence, or road, or any sign of human presence. It is possible you are
				living hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.
			</p>

			<p>
				You gaze upward. One of the puffy, white cumulus clouds is moving in a
				strange fashion. It is descending! A spaceship is landing right before your
				eyes, only a few hundred yards away!
