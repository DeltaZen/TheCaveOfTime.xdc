			<p>
				You resolutely trudge along a rocky ridge. It has been cleared of whirling
				snow by the fierce wind, which bites and blows against your body.
			</p>

			<p>
				The world seems transformed, and much for the worse. You must find a house
				or a cabin—people who can help you—or you will die.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you ponder your fate, you stumble and fall, plunging into a deep
				crevasse. You black out and later awaken, still shivering, but in a warmer
				place at least. By the dim amber light, you can see that somehow you have
				fallen back into one of the chambers in the Cave of Time. A passageway
				leads to the right, another to the left. Does one lead to the future and
				one to the past?
