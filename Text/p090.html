				Inside the cave again, you feel depressed and confused. Your eyes do not
				seem to be getting used to the dim light. You cannot find any passageways
				leading to other times. You feel increasingly drowsy. Soon you fall asleep
				on the cold clay floor of the cave.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometime later you awaken. The cave is pitch dark, but the bright light at
				the opening tells you the sun is shining brightly outside. You walk out
				into the daylight and, to your surprise and delight, you see Snake Canyon,
				the trail, the grove of pine trees nearby—everything just as it was when
				you entered the cave. Even the sun is in the same place, just about to pass
				behind the rim of the canyon. Somehow you have returned to your own time—or
				more precisely, the time it was before you fell asleep in the cave.
			</p>

			<p>
				You rub your eyes and start down the path back to the Red Creek Ranch with
				a story to tell that no one will believe, but that you will never forget.
