				Itâ€™s less than a mile to Parkersville, and the President shakes your hand
				and wishes you luck. One of the soldiers arranges with the station agent
				for a carriage to take you to a farm owned by an old friend of his.
			</p>

			<p>
				You soon become a member of the family. They are good people and make you
				feel very much at home. You are surprised to learn, however, that they plan
				to sell their farm and move to California. The new life in the West they
				describe is so appealing that you decide to go with them.
			</p>

			<p>
				You never regret it, except, sometimes, you wish you could see your own
				time again.
