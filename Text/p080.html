				“Since you can’t find your way to your own time,” you say, “perhaps we can
				find my time.” You lead her back a short distabce, until you come to an
				unusually wide tunnel. You stop, and Louisa looks at you inquiringly.
				“Let’s try this one,” you say.

				After traveling almost an hour, the two of you smile with joy to ee light
				ahead, and you soon come out of the tunnel and stand on reddish sandy
				ground, surveying a saucer-shaped terrain. The air is as fresh and clear as
				on a crisp, fall day. You guess that you may be in the crater of an extinct
				volicano. Suddenly, there is a thundering roar behind you. Louisa and you
				run from a landslide that buries the tunnel leading back to the Cave of
				Time.

				“I wonder what year it is?” Louisa asks, after the two of you have
				collected your wits.

			<p>
				For the first time you look up at the sun. It is four times as large as the
				sun you knew, though not as bright. It is almost directly overhead, yet its
				color is a rusty red.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I don’t know the answer,” you reply, “but from what I’ve read about
				astronomy, I would guess it’s the year 2,000—plus about four billion years.
