				There is a certain tone in the knight’s laughter that does not inspire your
				trust, so you thank him graciously and tell him you have other business to
				attend to.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Then go to it,” the knight replies. “Take care to keep your business drier
				than yourself!”
			</p>

			<p>
				He gallops off in a rush. You are glad to be rid of him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eager to find the entrance to the Cave of Time, you climb up behind the
				rock wall that slopes into the pond. After searching for an hour, you find
				a tunnel leading underground.
