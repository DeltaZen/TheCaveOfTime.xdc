				You walk into the interior of the strange cavern; then wait while your eyes
				become accustomed to the dim, amber light. Gradually you can make out the
				two tunnels. One curves downward to the right; the other leads upward to
				the left.
			</p>

			<p>
				It occurs to you that the one leading down may go to the past and the one
				leading up may go to the future.
