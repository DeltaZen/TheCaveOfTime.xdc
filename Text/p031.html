				You take the first tunnel and follow it on and on until you begin to wonder
				whether you are going around in circles. What can this mean? Perhaps time
				itself is slowing. You are nearing the point of exhaustion, and begin to
				feel very cold. You see an opening up ahead and stars shining. You step
				outside on barren ground. It is bitter cold. Even though there is no wind,
				you know you will freeze if you stay more than a few minutesâ€”maybe not that
				long, for the air seems very thin, as if you were on top of a very high
				mountain. You find yourself gasping for breath. You look up at the clear,
				cold night sky studded with thousands of stars. Among the stars, you notice
				a disk the size of the sun that gives off a dim red light like a dying
				ember.
