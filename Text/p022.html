				The laughing knight helps you up on his horse and you sit uncomfortably as
				it canters over the countryside. After traveling a mile or so, you come to
				a great, stone castle. The horse trots across the drawbridge and into the
				stable.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Jump,” the knight calls to you, and you slide off the rear of the horse.
				The knight escorts you into the grand chamber of the castle. All about you
				are stewards, attendants, and knights. A few minutes later you find
				yourself bowing before the King himself.
			</p>

			<p>
				After hearing your story, the King looks gravely at his advisors and
				knights and stewards. “Does anyone believe this tale?” he asks.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everyone cries back, “No, Your Majesty,” or “Certainly not, Your Majesty.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“Then tell us the truth!” the King roars at you.
