				When you tell the guard you are innocent, he scowls and slams shut the door
				of the cell. “You’ll not take me to the devil with you!” he calls back as
				he walks away.

				The next day you are brought into a courtroom before a stem looking judge.
				After hearing the charges against you and listening to what you have to
				say, he shakes his head and scowls angrily. Then he looks at the prosecutor
				and pounds his fist on the bench.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Your charge against this person is for disorderly conduct, but the
				specifications you give are `strange clothes and telling stories invented
				by the devil.’ What you really are charging is witchcraft! There will be no
				such madness in my court and let me have none of it again from you! Case
				dismissed.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The judge not only sets you free, but afterwards gives you a home to live
				in and helps you on your way to a good and happy life in the Eighteenth
				Century.
