				As you start walking back toward the ranch, you notice the trail seems very
				different than you remember it, though of course moonlight can play tricks
				on your eyes. But you suddenly realize you are not walking on the trail at
				all, but on what seems to be a dried-up river bed. You hurry back to the
				cave entrance. You look around you and realize the whole landscape has
				changed. While you were in the cave, torrents of water have washed out the
				trail; yet there is not so much as a puddle left. You shiver. It is cold,
				much colder than it should be at this time of year. You take a jacket out
				of your backpack and put it on, but you are still freezing.
			</p>

			<p>
				At least the world about you seems brighter. Itâ€™s getting light in the
				east. The sun will soon be up. You look at your watch. It has run down,
				though you wound it only a few hours ago. Nothing seems to make sense
				anymore.
			</p>

			<p>
				You know you should get back to the ranch as quickly as possible; yet
				somehow you feel the only way to change things back to the way they were is
				to re-enter the cave.
