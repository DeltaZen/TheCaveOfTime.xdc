				You do your best to make up a story about how you ran away from home, but
				Nick sees that you are not telling him the truth. While you’re talking, he
				packs up his fishing gear, says goodbye, and walks off.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once he is out of sight, you start down the road and, after a mile or so,
				reach a settled area. While you are standing near a church, wondering what
				to do next, a constable approaches and asks where you’re from. This time
				you try to explain what really happened. After listening awhile, he arrests
				you for disorderly conduct and locks you up in the local jail.
			</p>

			<p>
				Later in the day, a big, stupid-looking guard comes to bring you a ration
				of soup and bread. He is fascinated by your strange clothes and by the
				rumors he has heard about you. After opening the door to your cell, he
				hands you your food and stands back and looks at you curiously.
			</p>

			<p>
				“They say you’re in league with the devil,” he says. “Is it so?”
