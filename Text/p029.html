				As you land, the mammoth shudders like a horse shaking off flies. It begins
				lumbering along up the valley, apparently unaware you are still clinging to
				its wooly back, keeping warm and enjoying the ride.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mammoth reaches high ground, nibbles at some bark, and then walks on.
				Perhaps it will carry you near some cave men who will give you food and
				shelter.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suddenly the mammoth stops and turns its head—listening for something. You
				look up and see human figures approaching from two sides. They are carrying
				spears and clubs. The mammoth begins to run. You hold on tight. The hunters
				follow—screaming and yelling. You can’t see where the mammoth is heading,
				but you’re afraid the hunters may drive it off a cliff. Yet, if you jump
				off while it’s running, you could be badly hurt.
