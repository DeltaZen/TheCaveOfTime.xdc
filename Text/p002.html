				You’ve hiked through Snake Canyon once before while visiting your Uncle
				Howard at Red Creek Ranch, but you never noticed any cave entrance. It
				looks as though a recent rock slide has uncovered it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Though the late afternoon sun is striking the opening of the cave, the
				interior remains in total darkness. You step inside a few feet, trying to
				get an idea of how big it is. As your eyes become used to the dark, you see
				what looks like a tunnel ahead, dimly lit by some kind of phosphorescent
				material on its walls. The tunnel walls are smooth, as if they were shaped
				by running water. After twenty feet or so, the tunnel curves. You wonder
				where it leads. You venture in a bit further, but you feel nervous being
				alone in such a strange place. You turn and hurry out.
			</p>

			<p>
				A thunderstorm may be coming, judging by how dark it looks outside.
				Suddenly you realize the sun has long since set, and the landscape is lit
				only by the pale light of the full moon. You must have fallen asleep and
				woken up hours later. But then you remember something even more strange.
				Just last evening, the moon was only a slim crescent in the sky.
			</p>

			<p>
				You wonder how long you’ve been in the cave. You are not hungry. You don’t
				feel you have been sleeping. You wonder whether to try to walk back home by
				moonlight or whether to wait for dawn, rather than risk losing your footing
				on the steep and rocky trail.
