				Much as you would like to see the inside of the alien ship, you have no
				desire to be whisked off into space. You step back to what you hope is a
				safe distance and watch what happens. In a moment the portal closes, and
				almost instantly the ship rises, silently, straight up. Within a few
				minutes it is lost from view. You walk over to look more closely at the
				primitive looking people sleeping on the pallet. They begin to stir and
				stretch and rub their eyes as if waking from a long sleep.
