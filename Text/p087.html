				You have no desire to be involved in building the Great Wall of China, or,
				for that matter, to be taken to another planet by aliens. You walk back
				into the crevasse, hoping to find a tunnel that might lead to another time.
				You walk along the bottom of the crevasse and reach an opening on the other
				side of the ridge, where you half expect to see the rolling countryside,
				the stream and the space ship that were there before.
			</p>

			<p>
				Instead, the crevasse leads to the ocean! Like a bad dream, where the scene
				suddenly changes into something entirely different, you find that the hills
				have become waves, which surround you so that the rock you are standing on
				is only a reef protruding a few yards above the wind-swept seas. And there
				seems to be no escape, because, for all you can tell, you are standing on
				the only land in the world.
