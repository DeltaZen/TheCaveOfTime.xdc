				You go to work in Mr. Nelsonâ€™s shop and soon become proficient in the art
				of printing. But after awhile, you become increasingly unhappy. Mr. Nelson
				refuses to raise your wages or give you a chance to own part of the
				business. There are no jobs available for you in Boston, so you decide to
				move to Philadelphia, where you have heard there is a greater demand for
				printing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Happily, Mr. Nelson agrees to release you from your indenture, and by
				selling almost all your possessions, you are able to raise enough money to
				engage passage on a coastal schooner. After a long and stormy voyage down
				the coast, your ship docks early on a Sunday morning at the Market Street
				wharf in Philadelphia.
			</p>

				You are tired and hungry and you use some of your last money to buy a loaf
				of bread. Out of curiosity, you follow some well-dressed people into the
				Quaker meeting house. The people seat themselves, but, following custom, no
				one speaks. It is so peaceful you fall sound asleep. When you awaken, the
				Quakers welcome you. One family gives you lodging and, fortunately, you are
				able to get a job with one of the two printers in the town.
			</p>

			<p>
				You work hard to improve your skills as a printer. Within a few years, with
				the help of some friends, you are able to raise enough money to go into
				business on your own.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your printing business thrives, and after awhile you start your own
				newspaper. It begins to look as if the Eighteenth Century is a pretty good
				time for you to be alive.
