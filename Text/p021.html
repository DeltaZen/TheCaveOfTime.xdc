			<p>
				You turn and walk back out of the cave. It should be dawn by now, but, as
				you grope your way toward the entrance, you canâ€™t see any light coming into
				the cave. You press against the walls, feeling for an opening. Your hands
				pass across something cold, wet, and hard. Ice! The entrance is sealed by
				it. Blocks of ice protrude into the cave.
			</p>

			<p>
				You step back, feeling confused and helpless. You wish it were just a
				dream. You retrace your steps a way, trying to think clearly. You know that
				your only chance to get out of the cave is to follow one of the two
				branches before you.
