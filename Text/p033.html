				You make your way along in the dim light. Ahead of you is a ladder. You
				take hold of it and begin to climb. Suddenly you hear a terrible grinding,
				crunching noise. The ladder shudders. You hold on tight for a few minutes
				after the noise subsides. Then you continue up the ladder and a moment
				later pull yourself out into the crisp, cold night air. Lights are glowing
				all around you. In front of you is a large slab of ice. You feel a strange
				motion as if the ground is moving. When you touch the ground with your
				hand, you feel wood. Not far from you is a railing. Beyond it—the sea!
				Above you are stars more numerous and brilliant than you have seen before.
				You realize you are on the deck of a very large ship.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not far from you, hanging on a hook, is an enormous life preserver.
				Stenciled on it in black letters is the word TITANIC. You know there was
				only one ship that ever bore that name, that it made only one voyage, that
				it struck a huge iceberg, and that three hours later it was resting on the
				bottom of the Atlantic.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you walk along the deck of the <i>Titanic</i>, you realize that below
				the water line thousands of gallons of water per minute are pouring into
				the forward compartments. The people don’t seem to realize what’s
				happening. The sea is as calm as glass. The band on the deck below you is
				playing a waltz. Several men in long black coats and women in fur jackets
				are walking close by.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Goodness,” one woman says, “I can’t understand why the captain has stopped
				the ship. If we are late docking in New York, I’m going to lodge a
				complaint with the owners.”
