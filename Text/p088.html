				You walk back through the cavern, wondering if the entrance will still be
				blocked by ice. This time, though, you are greeted by a warm breeze.
				Sunlight is shining on the ground near the entrance, and you walk outside.
			</p>

			<p>
				Squinting your eyes in the bright light, you see a world totally different
				from the one you know. You are on a hillside. For miles and miles you can
				see grassy plains speckled with lakes. Nearby is a forest of towering
				ferns, swaying in the wind. The world before you seems strangely quiet,
				except for the faint rumbling of distant thunder. Suddenly, the thunder
				seems much closer—and louder. The thundering sound is moving through the
				ferns. You run up the hill looking for a place to hide. A huge shadow
				passes on the ground. Above you, soaring through the air, is a creature
				larger than any bird you have seen.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now it is clear what has been happening. The cave is a crack in the
				universe—a place outside space-time. Once inside its tunnels you could find
				yourself at any place, at any time. If you enter again you might be sent to
				a place from which you could never escape. Yet that is your only hope of
				returning to your own place and time.
