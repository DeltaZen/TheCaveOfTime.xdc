				You make friendly gestures. The man holding the vine steps back and smiles.
				The people talk to you in a friendly fashion, but you cannot understand
				what they are saying, nor can they understand you. You feel awkward, but
				happy to be safe and warm for the moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Several people have gone back to working on their paintings. You decide to
				try communicating through drawing. You begin to draw a picture of yourself
				eating. The cave people laugh, but one of them brings you a slice of half -
				cooked meat. It doesn’t taste very good, but you are so hungry you don’t
				mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Gradually you make friends and learn a few words. Some of the people go
				hunting and come back with game. Others make clothing from animal skins.
				You help with cleaning and cooking and each day paint a picture on the
				walls. The others are fascinated by your drawings of airplanes, ships, and
				cars—things they see only as abstract designs, for they have no way of
				knowing what function they could serve.
			</p>

			<p>
				One day a group of other people visit. You have never seen them before, but
				your friends welcome them warmly, holding a great feast in their honor.
				After everyone is through eating, the conversation intensifies. You can
				tell that the cave people are talking about a serious problem. Then, one by
				one, they drift off to sleep. You walk outside to see if you can learn
				anything. The ground is covered with deep snow. A bitter cold wind blows
				the snow in whirling clouds.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next morning, the people pack up their belongings and they urge you to do
				so also. Some migration is obviously intended—no doubt to a warmer climate.
				You feel you should go with the cave people, but you have a great longing
				to return to your own home, and your only hope of doing so is to find your
				way back to the Cave of Time.
