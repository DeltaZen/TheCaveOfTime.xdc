				You walk along the right-hand passageway for a long distance, praying that
				you can find a tunnel that will lead to your own time. You choose one of
				the many tunnels you see and follow it. Instead of rising to the surface,
				you enter a brightly-lighted chamber, in the center of which is a bearded,
				old man seated in a chair.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Welcome,” he says, as if he has been expecting you.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Thank you,” you reply. “Can you help me find my way back to my own time?”
			</p>

			<p>
				The old man smiles. “First of all,” he says, “tell me why you want to
				return to your own time instead of another time.”
