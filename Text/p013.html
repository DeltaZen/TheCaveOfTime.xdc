				You decide to wait, but soon regret it. A guard visits you twice a day and
				brings you only black bread and water. In a few days you feel almost too
				weak to escape even if you have the chance.
			</p>

			<p>
				But just as you are beginning to despair of ever regaining your freedom,
				the guard walks in, smiling.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The King has ordered you out of here,” he says. “We have a much more
				important prisoner—a man who insulted the King’s horse.” He laughs in your
				face. You don’t know whether he is telling the truth or not, but he holds
				the door and waves you out. You walk down the long flight of stone steps to
				the main courtyard, free again—at least for the moment. The drawbridge is
				down and there seems to be nothing in the way of your leaving the castle.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a splendid black horse tied up near you, probably owned by one of
				the knights. It occurs to you that you could cover a lot of ground on that
				horse before anyone realizes what happened.
