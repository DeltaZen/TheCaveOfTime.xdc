				Could you change history and save hundreds of lives by warning the captain
				that the “unsinkable” <i>Titanic</i> is destined for the bottom of the
				Atlantic? You see some stairs leading to a higher deck, and you run up
				them.
			</p>

			<p>
				A steward is standing near the top. “You can’t come up here,” he cries. But
				you dart past him and run toward the forward part of the ship. You dash up
				another set of stairs, where you find yourself at the starboard wing of the
				bridge. The gray-bearded captain is standing only a few feet away, looking
				out to sea through his binoculars at a ship on the horizon.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Captain,” you call out “You may not realize it, but this ship will sink in
				only two or three hours.”
			</p>

			<p>
				He turns and looks at you gravely. “I know,” he says softly. “But we are
				going to fire distress rockets. That ship out there—the
				<i>Californian</i>—should respond to help us.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“They will not respond, Captain,” you tell him. “They can’t believe the
				<i>Titanic</i> could be in trouble, even though they see your rockets. Your
				only hope is to put your strongest men in a lifeboat and have them row
				toward the <i>Californian</i> at top speed—firing rockets as they
				approach.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“Great heavens, you have bold ideas,” the captain replies, “but I need
				every man I have to lower our lifeboats and keep order among the
				passengers. I can’t believe the <i>Californian</i> will not come when they
				see our rockets.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Now go to the deck below. Mr. Lightoller will see that you have a place in
				a lifeboat.”
			</p>

			<p>
				With that the captain turns and strides away, giving orders to an officer
				nearby. You sadly return down the stairs and wait in line for one of the
				places in a lifeboat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Two hours later, you sit huddled in the crowded boat, shivering in the cold
				breeze, and watch the great <i>Titanic</i> slip beneath the waves—with
				1,500 people still aboard—together with your only hope of finding your way
				back to the Cave of Time.
