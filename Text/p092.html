				You continue a long distance until you come to the next tunnel. From there
				it is only a short distance until you reach the surface. An amazing sight
				meets your eyes.
			</p>

			<p>
				As far as you can see, the land looks like a beautiful park, with soft,
				feathery grass and towering trees. Here and there are clusters of
				multicolored, dome-shaped buildings, connected by ramps, terraces and
				walkways. Some people dressed in simple khaki pants and shirts and tan
				sneakers walk up to you. They do not understand your language, nor you
				theirs. They look much like the people of your time except that they are
				unusually trim, muscular, and healthy looking, and they are a good deal
				smaller than your own people.
			</p>

			<p>
				They take you inside a dome-shaped building and show you electronic
				equipment that looks like a computer. You notice a typewriter, so you sit
				at it and type a message.
			</p>

			<p>
				The computer prints out a reply. It apparently has access to memory banks
				containing your language. You soon discover you are living in the year
				3742.
			</p>

			<p>
				Through computer instruction you are able to learn the language, which you
				find is similar to English, so you are soon able to communicate with your
				hosts.
			</p>

			<p>
				They are not at all surprised to hear that you arrived through the Cave of
				Time.
			</p>

			<p>
				“You are not the first,” the head of the household tells you, “but we have
				visitors from other times only once in a great while. When someone comes,
				we are always glad to learn about life in another era, because here we have
				achieved a sort of paradise—we do not work, and the world is at peace. It
				is a perfect society. That is why primitive epochs, such as yours, interest
				us so much.”
