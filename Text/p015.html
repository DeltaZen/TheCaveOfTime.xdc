				“Think nothing of it,” the King replies. “We would do as much for any
				villain. We like your spirit and, though your story makes as much sense as
				a dancing mule, it brought laughter to our eyes. You have, without meaning
				it we are sure, performed a service for your King. We thank you.

				“We’ll see that you have a horse and some pieces of gold,” the King
				continues. “Go and make your fortune. We command you though—come once a
				year and tell us a story no less amusing than what we have heard from your
				lips.”

			<p>
				“My liege,” he replies.

			<p>

				life as is possible in the year 982.
