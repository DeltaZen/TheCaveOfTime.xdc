				You have no wish to risk sinking with the <i>Titanic</i>, so you climb back
				down the ladder into the hold of the shipâ€”hoping that somehow you will find
				your way back to the cave. In your haste, you lose your grip and fall. You
				reach out, but too late. You land so hard you are knocked out. When you
				awaken, you are in one of the passageways of the cave.
