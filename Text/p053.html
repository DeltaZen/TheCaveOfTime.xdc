				You hold tightly to tufts of wool, hoping the mammoth will slow down enough
				so you can safely slide off. But suddenly it pitches forward, making a
				terrible bellowing. In an instant you realize you are falling through
				space. You cry out helplessly as you lose your grip, falling faster and
				faster.

				paleontologist, finds your bones next to those of a wooly mammoth in the
				Red Creek excavation, he is amazed at how closely you resemble a
				twentieth-century human being.
