				Although you feel you would probably enjoy the printing business more than
				a career as a soap maker, you wish to remain free to take advantage of some
				other opportunity.
			</p>

			<p>
				The work with Uncle Ted is tedious. You feel you could not bear life
				devoted to making candles and soap. You spend most of your spare time
				reading what books you can lay hold of, but you are anxious to travel and
				see the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not long afterwards, you sign up on the brigantine, <i>Nina</i>, as a deck
				hand. The ship is owned by a rich merchant, and it is bound for Barbados in
				the West Indies with a load of lumber and then on to England.
			</p>

			<p>
				You find life at sea much harder than you expected, especially when you are
				required to climb the rigging in a howling gale, but eventually you become
				captain of your own ship. In every place you visit you ask the people you
				meet whether they have ever heard of the Cave of Time.
