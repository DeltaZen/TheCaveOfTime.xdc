				You walk on and on, hoping the passageway will lead you to your own time.
				You soon come to a tunnel that leads into a dark, musty room resembling the
				cellar of a large house. There are a great many people huddled in groups,
				sitting on blankets in complete darkness save for the light of a few
				flickering candles. You hear the dismal wail of a siren. Near the center of
				the room an old-fashioned radio sits on the table playing a mixture of
				classical music and static. Then the sirens stop, the ground shakes, and
				you hear a tremendous explosion nearby, then another further away, then
				another so close that a wall and half the ceiling come crashing down in a
				pile of rubble, blocking the tunnel. You and the others scramble to the
				opposite side of the room, coughing and gasping in the dust-filled air.

				You are about to begin a new life. The year is 1940; the place, London.
