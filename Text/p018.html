				You continue on, following a trail leading up a steep incline. You hear
				loud, trumpeting sounds from a nearby ravine—the sounds of a large animal.
				You climb over some rocks and find yourself looking down on one of the
				largest land mammals that ever lived—the wooly mammoth. Huge as this
				creature is, its size is exaggerated even more by its thick coat of wool.
			</p>

			<p>
				You are cold, desperate, and tired. From your rock ledge, only a few feet
				over the mammoth, you could drop down on its back, burrow into its warm
				wool, and ride where it takes you!
