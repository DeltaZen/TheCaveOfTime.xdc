				Slowly you unsheath your knife and then run for the entrance. The wolf is
				after you like a shot. It leaps and tears your bearskin coat. While the
				wolf is regaining its balance, you run into the cave and toward the left
				tunnel. The wolf runs after you. You look over your shoulder and lose your
				footing. Instead of falling on the ground, you feel yourself sliding down a
				long, steep chute. Far above, the wolf howls with frustration. You land in
				a heap at the bottom of a pitâ€”shaken but unharmed. There is a dark
				passageway to the left. You toss in a stone and, after what seems like a
				long time, you hear a splash far below. Fortunately, there is another
				passageway to the right, which is dimly lit by phosphorescent light.
