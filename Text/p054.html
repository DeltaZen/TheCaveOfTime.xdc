				You enter the next tunnel you come to. It becomes smaller and smaller until
				you must crawl. You continue this way for almost an hour. Finally, your
				faith is justified, for you smell a fresh breeze blowing across a field of
				new-mown hay.
			</p>

			<p>
				A moment later you are blinking your eyes in the bright sunlight, looking
				at a beautiful meadow nestled between gentle hills. A dozen or more cows
				are grazing near a meandering stream. In the distance is a dirt road. A
				farmer is sitting on a cart filled with hay. A dapple-gray horse is pulling
				the cart toward a big red barn in the distance. From the other direction
				you hear the mournful hooting of a train whistle.
			</p>

			<p>
				You turn around and see that you are only a few hundred feet from the
				railroad tracks. A train is chugging around the bend, puffs of black smoke
				rising from its coal-fired steam engine. You are out of the Ice Age, all
				right, but not exactly in your own time.
			</p>

			<p>
				The train slows down as it approaches you, and you smile as you see the
				reason whyâ€”a cow is standing on the tracks just ahead, looking as if it
				would not move for anything. The train pulls to a stop, and a man jumps
				down from the cab, waving a coal shovel at the cow, which waits almost
				until the man is upon her before strolling back into the pasture. At that
				moment you realize you could easily climb onto the back of the train.
