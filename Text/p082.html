				You go up to the base of the wall where the people are working. When they
				see you, they imagine you are a spy from some unknown tribe. Some guards
				capture you and force you to sit on a pile of rocks while they talk about
				you.
			</p>

			<p>
				After a while they point to one of the ladders. Two other people force you
				to start handing up rocks. You realize that you have been conscripted to
				work building a wall twenty feet high, twelve feet wide, and 1,400 miles
				long. You calculate it will take about ten billion rocks to build the wall.
				You wonder how many of them you will lift before you can escapeâ€”if you ever
				do.
