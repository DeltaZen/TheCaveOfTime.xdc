				You take a deep breath, dive down, and swim through the tunnel. There is
				light ahead. In a moment you surface in a beautiful lagoon. Thatched
				cottages are nestled among the palm trees that rim the white sand beach. A
				warm, soft breeze brings the scent of jasmine and the sound of strange
				melodies from sonorous drums. Looking out to the inlet from the sea, you
				can see a fleet of outrigger skiffs with multi-colored sails running into
				the lagoons before the wind, their owners leaning against the booms to hold
				the sails out.

				You walk toward the village. Several handsome, brown-skinned people see
				you. Some of them run away, but others walk toward you with hands held up
				in salute. Two children, holding garlands of flowers, run up to you.
				Someone callsâ€”` Alohar

				Soon you are sitting in front of a huge beach fire, cooking crabs and
				eating buana cake. Having never had a visitor before, your hosts are happy
				to see you. They welcome you into their society. Gradually you learn their
				language. The boys tell you they are your brothers; the girls that they are
				your sisters.
			</p>

			<p>
				You enjoy life in this new paradise, but you still wonder whether there
				might be a way to get back to the Cave of Time. Your new friends are unable
				to help. Perhaps if you journeyed inland you could find some who could.
				Your friends warn you against trying, however. They tell you that you will
				find only terrible jungles and rivers filled with crocodiles.
