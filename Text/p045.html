				“I am a philosopher,” the old man says, “who, when asked to choose a time,
				instead chose timelessness, so that, although nothing would ever happen in
				my life, I would have all the time in the world to think about it.”

				“Are you happy with your decision?”
			</p>

			<p>
				“No, because philosophy is nothing outside of time. Take the tunnel to your
				right. Return to your own time, and let your life be your philosophy.”
