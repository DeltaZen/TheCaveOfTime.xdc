				Holding your knife with its long ivory blade pointing upward, you advance
				very slowly, step by step, toward the wolf, which stands growling softly,
				apparently confused by your boldness.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then it springs. You lunge with your knife, twisting your body to avoid its
				awesome fangs. Your knife cuts through nothing but air, but the wolf
				succeeds only in tearing off your bearskin coat. It stops for an instant to
				sniff at the coat, and you turn and plunge your knife into its neck. The
				wolf twists, looks at you with hate in its eyes, and falls limp, its spinal
				cord severed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now you are a true Stone Age hunter. You skin the wolf and walk into the
				cave.
			</p>

			<p>
				You follow the right-hand tunnel, thinking you may find your way back to
				your own time, but suddenly you feel yourself falling—faster and faster
				into what seems a bottomless pit.
			</p>

			<p class="newsect">
				You feel yourself slowly regaining consciousness. You are in your bed at
				Red Creek Ranch, looking up at Uncle Howard. Standing nearby is a friend of
				his who is a doctor.
			</p>

			<p>
				“You took quite a bad fall climbing on those rocks up in the canyon,” Uncle
				Howard says. “Doc Parsons tells me he doesn’t know why you didn’t break any
				bones. We were real worried about you—thought you got lost in one of those
				caves up there.”
			</p>

			<p>
				You feel a bit dizzy and weak, so you just smile and say nothing. Probably
				no one would believe you anyway. Years later, though, you write a book
				about your adventures in the Cave of Time.
