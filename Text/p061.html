				You follow the tunnel downward a short distance, suddenly you are sliding.
				Your head strikes something and you are knocked unconscious.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you wake up, you find yourself by a small lake, bordered by woods. A
				boy about twelve years old is fishing nearby, but there is no one else in
				sight. You go up and introduce yourself, hoping you can find out what year
				it is without sounding crazy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fortunately, the boy is friendly and good natured. He tells you his name is
				Nick Tyler and that he lives on Birch Street. He works in his father’s
				business making candles and soap—the best in the Colonies, he says.
