				As you enter the cave, you see a flickering light ahead and you smell
				smoke. You make your way along a winding passageway and enter a large
				chamber. Fires rise out of earthen vessels.
			</p>

			<p>
				Several short, stocky people with straight black hair and primitive faces
				are painting pictures on the walls of the cave. They are dressed in animal
				skins. In a corner of the cave are beds of straw.
			</p>

			<p>
				You stand, slightly afraid, as the cave people drop their work and run over
				and stare at you in disbelief. The largest man is carrying a long vine. He
				steps forward as though he might seize you and tie you up.
