				Your hosts give you a fine bedroom with large windows overlooking the park
				on one side. On another wall is a beautiful painting of the California
				seacoast. When you push a button, the painting folds up to the ceiling,
				revealing a large screen. Your room contains a computer terminal that
				enables you to select any movie or other program you desire from over
				10,000 possibilities. There are even films where <i>you</i> are the main
				character and you can make choices as to what will happen next in the
				story. Then, if you donâ€™t like the way the plot is working out, <i>you</i>
				can go back to an earlier point and make different choices from then on.
			</p>

			<p>
				On your terminal you can also play games and flash pages of books or
				magazines on the screen. You can live quite well without even getting out
				of bed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually you go exploring. You meet other people, but you find none of
				them very interesting, so you spend most of your time watching the greatest
				movies of all time. Gradually you settle into your new life. One thing
				disturbs you. No one has made any new movies in the last 300 years.
