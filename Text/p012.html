				You jump far out and fall faster and faster. You enter the water feet first
				and hit bottom, but the soft mud receives you gently. In a few seconds you
				reach the surface. You swim to the outer banks of the moat, shaken but
				unharmed. You scramble up the bank and run for the cover of the forest.
			</p>

			<p>
				You walk along the edge of the forest until well out of sight of the
				castle, then head across the open countryside. You stop a peasant to ask
				him where you might stay for the night.

				“Walk up that hill and you’ll see before you the waters of Loch Ness,” he
				says. “You’ll find a place there.”
			</p>

			<p>
				You follow his directions and, seeing some little houses near the lake,
				proceed toward them. Darkness is setting in, and you are glad when you meet
				a fisherman who says he will give you shelter for the night. He and his
				wife are kindly people; they invite you to stay and earn your keep by
				helping them fish.
