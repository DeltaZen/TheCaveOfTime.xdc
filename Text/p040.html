				You cautiously approach the spaceship and, to your amazement, see that it
				is resting a foot or so above the ground, without any visible mechanism
				keeping it aloft. There are no engines, rocket exhausts, port holes,
				landing gear, antennae, or any equipment you might imagine a spaceship
				would need. You realize it must be the product of a supremely advanced
				civilization.

			<p>
				Trusting that such people have learned to be loving toward others, you
				approach the ship. A portal slides open, but all you can see within is
				shimmering blue light. A large cube is thrust out through the portal and
				lowered to the ground by mechanical arms. The top of the cube is withdrawn,
				leaving a pallet on which lie the sleeping forms of three men and three
				women, dressed in shrouds of animal skin. Their bodies and features remind
				you of pictures you have seen depicting the earliest men on earth. You have
				an impulse to jump aboard the spaceship before the portal closes.
