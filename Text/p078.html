				You’d rather spend the rest of your life searching for an entrance to the
				Cave of Time than settle for the placid life of a fishing village. So you
				bid your new friends farewell and set out over the countryside, headed
				south for London. Your goal is to find a ship to take you to America,
				though you know America hasn’t been discovered yet, for somehow you must
				find your way back to Red Creek Canyon and the Cave of Time.
			</p>

			<p>
				A few hours later, as you are walking on a road along the edge of the
				forest, some burly men ride out from behind a clump of trees.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We’ve got you,” one shouts. “You’re the one who escaped from the tower,
				aren’t you?” They force you upon a horse and ride at top speed toward the
				castle.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The penalty for escaping from the tower is hanging,” one of them tells
				you.
			</p>

			<p>
				You find out he is right.
