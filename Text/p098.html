				If you take the train, it may ruin your chance to return to the Cave of
				Time. It seems best to stay close to the tunnel. At any rate, you decide
				you will be able to think better after getting something to eat, so you
				walk over to the farmhouse.

				The farmer’s wife gives you a bowl of soup, but she won’t believe the story
				you make up to explain your presence there. You soon get the idea you are
				not welcome, so you trudge on into town, where the innkeeper lets you have
				a room for the night.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next morning you get a ride on a coach to Philadelphia. A Quaker family
				takes you in and helps you get work as a carpenter’s apprentice. You don’t
				like the job, and soon you leave Philadelphia to go to New York, where you
				are able to find a job working for a newspaper. Eventually you travel all
				over the world. You live a long and wonderful life, dying just a few years
				before you are born.
