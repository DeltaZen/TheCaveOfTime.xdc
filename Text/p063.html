				You hug your friends good-bye and climb the ridge bordering the jungle. You
				soon find an animal trail leading through the dense undergrowth into a
				tropical rain forest. The green canopy of treetops is far overhead and only
				an occasional dapple of sunlight reaches the spongy, dark ground. You walk
				on and on, hoping to reach the mountains, where you might find another
				entrance to the Cave of Time.

				Night falls and you make yourself a crude bed. Your mattress is the mossy
				floor of the forest. You spread out fern leaves for a sheet. Early the next
				morning, as the birds are beginning their morning songs, you are awakened
				by the boa constrictor wrapped around your neck.
