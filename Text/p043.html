				“And why do you want to be back with your family and friends?” the old man
				asks.

				a good reason to be in your own time. Take the next tunnel to your right,
				and you will find your way there. You have chosen to have only one time,
				have you not?”
			</p>

				“Then make the most of it,” he says, with one hand outstretched to wish you
				well.
