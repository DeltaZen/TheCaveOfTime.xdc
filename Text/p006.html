				You step into a niche in the rocks to escape the merciless blast of wind
				and lean back against the rock wall. Suddenly it crumbles under your
				weight, causing you to fall backward down a muddy slope and into a pond.
			</p>

			<p>
				The sun shines brightly down on you as you pick yourself up, dripping wet,
				and wade to the grassy shore. You look back at the rock, rising out of the
				pond, but you can’t see where you fell through.
			</p>

			<p>
				While you are collecting your senses, a horse comes prancing up, its rider
				dressed in tin armor—a knight out of the history books—enough to make you
				laugh. The horseman lifts off his helmet and laughs himself.
			</p>

			<p>
				“What a place for a bath!” he calls out. “Well, it was worth it—you’re
				cleaner than a pig!” He almost falls off his horse, he is laughing so hard.
				“But climb on and I’ll take you back to the castle,” he says. “We’ll see if
				we can’t make a human out of you yet.”
