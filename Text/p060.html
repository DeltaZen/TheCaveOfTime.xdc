				There is something deadening about the perfect future society that makes
				you want to return to your own time as quickly as possible. With a brief
				word of farewell, you hurry back to the tunnel, climb down, and find a fork
				to the right that you hope will take you toward the right time. Soon you
				are climbing up toward the surface, excited about the discovery you are
				about to make.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you reach the surface, it is completely dark. A chill wind is blowing.
				You sit resolutely waiting for dawn so that you can see what kind of a
				world you are in. Meanwhile, there is no way of telling what time it is,
				either by your watch or by the stars.
			</p>

			<p>
				You hear loud, clicking sounds all around you, mostly in the distance, but
				some quite close. As the orange-pink glow of oncoming dawn lightens the
				eastern sky, you see nearby the shape of a creature that is the size of a
				sheep but has a very different appearance.
