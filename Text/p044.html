				“Ah, you are a shrewd one,” the old man says. “You’ll try to get two loaves
				of bread, rather than settle for one. Well, I’ll show you one other time,
				and, if you don’t like it, just say so, and I’ll return you to your own
				time, if there is time to do so. Take the tunnel to your left.”
			</p>

				You follow his direction, walk through the tunnel, and come out onto a city
				street. Instantly you realize there is a war going on. Bombs and rockets
				are exploding all around you. You cry out to the old man, asking to be
				returned to the Cave of Time, but there is no time left.
